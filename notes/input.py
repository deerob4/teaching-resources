# We can easily get input fron the user.
# Use the input() function, like so:

name = input("What is your name? ")

# This then assigns whatever is typed in to the 'name' variable.

print("Hello there " + name + "!")

# This can be very useful in a wide range of scenarios.
# For example, we could collect the user's DOB, and tell them
# if they are too old or young to use the script.
