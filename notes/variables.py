# We can use a variable to store pieces of data - anything, really.

name = "John Smith"

# The variable 'name' now contains the string 'John Smith'.
# If we were to do this:

print(name)

# The words 'John Smith' would be printed.
# It works for other data types:

answer = 10 + 10
print(answer)

# This would print out '20'.
# If we did:

print(answer + answer)

# Then '40' would be printed out. You can call a variable
# most names, but some words are protected, and so will give an
# error message. Some of these are:

# and
# from 
# for
# while
# try
# except

# and others. You should always try and give a variable a name that
# makes sense. Consider:

word = 10
number = "word"

# The variable names do not reflect what is stored inside them, and
# so could become very confusing later on.
